### About me
Hello, my name is Emma and I am still at the beginning of learning programming. Originally, I come from the video sector. As a trained media designer for image and sound, I worked in television for 4 years. First in the editorial department as a video journalist and finally in marketing production, where I created promotional videos for clients. Currently, I am part of the Web Development Bootcamp at neue fische to expand my knowledge and delve into the field of web development.
